# The server_name is the pretty name of this server. It is used as a suffix for user
# and room ids. Examples: matrix.org, conduit.rs

# The Conduit server needs all /_matrix/ requests to be reachable at
# https://your.server.name/ on port 443 (client-server) and 8448 (federation).

# If that's not possible for you, you can create /.well-known files to redirect
# requests (delegation). See
# https://spec.matrix.org/latest/client-server-api/#getwell-knownmatrixclient
# and
# https://spec.matrix.org/v1.9/server-server-api/#getwell-knownmatrixserver
# for more information

server_name = "SERVER_NAME"

# Servers listed here will be used to gather public keys of other servers (notary trusted key servers).
#
# The default behaviour for conduwuit is to attempt to query trusted key servers before querying the individual servers.
# This is done for performance reasons, but if you would like to query individual servers before the notary servers
# configured below, set to
#
# (Currently, conduwuit doesn't support batched key requests, so this list should only contain Synapse servers)
# Defaults to `matrix.org`
trusted_servers = ["matrix.org"]

### Database configuration

# This is the only directory where conduwuit will save its data, including media.
# Note: this was previously "/var/lib/matrix-conduit"
database_path = "/var/lib/conduwuit"

# Database backend: Only rocksdb and sqlite are supported. Please note that sqlite
# will perform significantly worse than rocksdb as it is not intended to be used the
# way it is by conduwuit. sqlite only exists for historical reasons.
database_backend = "rocksdb"

### Network

# The port(s) conduwuit will be running on. You need to set up a reverse proxy such as
# Caddy or Nginx so all requests to /_matrix on port 443 and 8448 will be
# forwarded to the conduwuit instance running on this port
# Docker users: Don't change this, you'll need to map an external port to this.
# To listen on multiple ports, specify a vector e.g. [8080, 8448]
port = 6167

# default address (IPv4 or IPv6) conduwuit will listen on. Generally you want this to be
# localhost (127.0.0.1 / ::1). If you are using Docker or a container NAT networking setup, you
# likely need this to be 0.0.0.0.
address = "0.0.0.0"

# Max request size for file uploads
max_request_size = 20_000_000 # in bytes

# Vector list of IPv4 and IPv6 CIDR ranges / subnets *in quotes* that you do not want conduwuit to send outbound requests to.
# Defaults to RFC1918, unroutable, loopback, multicast, and testnet addresses for security.
#
# To disable, set this to be an empty vector (`[]`).
# Please be aware that this is *not* a guarantee. You should be using a firewall with zones as doing this on the application layer may have bypasses.
#
# Currently this does not account for proxies in use like Synapse does.
